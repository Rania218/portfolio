Currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering and Systems Security at Mohamed V University, my name's Rania Moutee, a 21-year-old student passionate about building secure, innovative, and scalable digital solutions. With a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, computer networks, and systems design, I bring a versatile technical skill set to every project I undertake.
Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematical and Computer Sciences from the Faculty of Sciences in Rabat, where I also contributed to GoVirtual — the university's first virtual reality club — enhancing my expertise in emerging technologies.
Fluent in both English and French, I have successfully delivered projects in areas such as e-commerce platforms and mobile application development. I am now focused on further expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity and advanced system engineering, driven by a commitment to continuous learning, innovation, and excellence.
