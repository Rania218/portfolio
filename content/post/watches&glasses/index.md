## Detailed description

I’m happy to share the Watches&Glasses project I worked on with ABDELHAMID MAATAOUI.

Watches&Glasses is a mobile commerce (M-commerce) application for selling watches and glasses, integrating augmented reality (AR) to enhance the shopping experience by allowing users to "try on" products virtually before purchasing. The project aimed to increase customer confidence in online purchases and minimize return rates.

Technologies Used:

-Blender: Created and optimized 3D models of watches and glasses for AR visualization.

-Unity & Vuforia: Implemented the AR functionality, using Vuforia within Unity to allow users to overlay products in real-time.

-Android Studio (Java, XML): Developed the mobile app interface, ensuring a smooth, user-friendly experience.

-Firebase: Integrated Firebase for real-time database management, user authentication, and analytics.

-JSON: Managed data exchange between the app and server, ensuring fast and efficient data handling.
